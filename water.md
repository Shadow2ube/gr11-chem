# Water

## Properties
- Forms a V shape ([[molecule shapes#Bent]])
- Oxygen has more [[electronegativity]] than hydrogen, forming a partial negativity
- Is a hydrogen bond ([[intermolecular forces#Hydrogen bond]])
- Has a boiling point due to hydrogen bond

### Dissolution
- Polar nature is why some substances will dissolve while others don't
- Most [[ionic compound]]s dissolve easily
	- Partial charges of the water molecules cause them to be attracted to the ions, surrounding and subsequently breaking them down, making them dissolve
- [[Molecular compound]]s
	- Oil is a [[non-polar covalent bond]] which is why it does not dissolve
