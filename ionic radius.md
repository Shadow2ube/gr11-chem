# Ionic radius
## Positive Ions
- Smaller than the neutral atoms they're derived from
	- Electrons are lost from energy levels farthest from the [[nucleus]]
	- Less energy shells & fewer electrons but same [[proton pull]]
	- fromn [[nucleus]]

## Negative Ions
- Larger than the neutral atoms they're derived from
	- Electrons are gained, resulting in smaller effective [[nuclear charge]] for greater number of electrons
	- Repulsive forces between electrons increase accross the [[period]]s
