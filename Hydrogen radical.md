# Hydrogen radicals
## Balancing
- add H+ to radicals causes the [[charge]] to change

## Naming
- add a "Hydrogen" in front for all polyatomic ions, except Phosphate ($PO_4^{-3}$)
- add a "bi" in front of all polyatomic ions except phosphate ($PO_4^{-3}$)

## For phosphate ions
Phosphate is special because it can accept more than one Hydrogen before becoming neutral

Naming & charge depends on number of hydrogen atoms added
- Monohydrogen phosphate ($HPO_4^{-2}$): charge of -2
- Dihydrogen phosphate ($H_2PO_4^{-1}$): charge of -1
