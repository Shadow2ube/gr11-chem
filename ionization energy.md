# Ionization Energy
The amount of energy required to remove an electronfrom an [[atom]] or ion in the [[gas]]eous state
- Removing an [[electron]] creates a **POSITIVE ION**
- The amount of energy deperends on which [[shell]] the [[electron]] is from
	- The closer the shell, the more energy is required to seperate the [[electron]]
- The [[electron]] held most weakly will be removed first. Eg: [[valence electron]]s
