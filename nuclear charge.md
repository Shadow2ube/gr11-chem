# Nuclear charge
Is a measure of the strength of a [[nucleus]]' oull
- Moving across a [[period]] # of protons in the [[nucleus]] increases
- The # of electrons also increases, but the inner [[shell]]s stay the same
- Greatly affects the [[periodic trends]] because [[shielding effect]] is not an issue across a [[period]]

## TLDR
More protons, higher [[ionization energy]]
