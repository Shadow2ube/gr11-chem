# Empirical formula
- Simplest formula
	- The formula of a [[compound]] that represents a [[mole]] ration in the smallest whole number ratio of atoms
		- Ex $1CH_2+3NO_4$ -> 1 [[mole]] $CH_2$ for every 3 [[mole]] $NO_4$
- Different compounds may have the same [[percent composition]] but contain different numbers of [[atom]]s in the molecule
	- $C_2H_4$ has the same [[percent composition]] as $CH_2$

## To obtain
1. Find the [[mass]] of each element present, if required
2. Calculate the number of moles of each [[element]]
3. Divide each by the smallest number of moles to get the simplest whole number ratio
4. If the whole numbers are not obtained, multiply by the smallest number that will give all whole numbers
- Ratios
	- $1.5*2=3$
	- $1.33*3=4$
	- $1.25*4=5$
