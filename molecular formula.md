# Molecular Formula
- The actual ratio of the number of atoms of each type bonded to form a molecule
- Can be equal to [[empirical formula]] but does not have to be

## Determining
- In order to determine, you must know
- The [[empirical formula]]
- The [[molar mass]] of the [[compound]]

## To obtain
1. Find the [[molar mass]] of the [[empirical formula]]
2. Divide [[molar mass]] of the actual [[Compound]] by the [[molar mass]] of the [[empirical formula]]
	- To get the # of units
3. Multiply each element in the [[empirical formula]] by the number of units to get the molecular formula
	- Ex: $SCl *2$ -> $S_2Cl_2$
