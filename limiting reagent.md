# Limiting Reagent
The reactant that will be fully consumed first in a chemical [[reaction]]. Thus limits how much of a product can be formed

## To obtain
1. Find the number of [[mole]]s of both reactants (use [[Units#Formulae]])
2. Divide the number of [[mole]]s by the coefficient in a balanced chemical [[reaction]]
	- *NOTE: Do this in a box because these calculations are only to find the limiting reagent*
3. Whichever number is lower will be used up first, which is the limiting reagent

see [[excess reagent]] to find excess
