# Lewis dot diagram

## Drawing
1. Add up the total amount of valence electrons for each atom (called and electron pool).
2. Determine the central atom (usually has the highest bonding capacity) and put the surrounding atoms around it.
3. Add electron pairs to bond the central atom to the surrounding atoms. 4. Fill the valences of the surrounding atoms using electron pairs.
5. Any left over electrons are added in pairs on the central atom.
6. If the central atoms octet is not filled then share an electron pair from the surrounding atoms (if the central atom creates an octet - exceptions include Be, B, and some higher number non metals).


### Ionic bond

### Ions
- Add in extra valence electrons based on the ionic charge
- Indicate the charge always with square brackets (\[ \__ionic [[compound]]_\_ \])

### Coordinate bonds (Dative Bond)
- Bonds in which one atom gives both electrons ot form the bond
	- Represented as an arrow - instead of a line - toward the one being shared with

### Exceptions
- Be
- B
- S
- P
- Odd electron molecules
