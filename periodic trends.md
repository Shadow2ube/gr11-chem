# Periodic trends
## Background
- Mendelev: The first periodic table
	- Arranged elements by increasing [[atomic mass]]
	- Noticed a regular pattern in chemical and physical properties
	- Had blank spaces
		- Predicted the existence of eleements not yet discovered based on properties
- Mosely: Modern periodic table
	- Determined atomic number of elements by determining nuclear [[charge]]
	- Arrangedtable by increasing **atomic numbers**

## Modern periodic table
Elements in groups have similar [[physical property]] and [[chemical property]]

### Periodic law
- When elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, there is a regular pattern in their chemical and physical properties

Differences in chemical/physical properties of metals and non-metals can be related to differences in...
- [[electron arrangement]]
- [[radius of atom]]s and ions
- [[ionization energy]]
- [[electron affinity]]

## TLDR
- Across a [[period]] -> Atomic radius **DECREASES**, going **LEFT TO RIGHT**, because [[proton pull]] **INCREASES**
	- Reason: [[nuclear charge]]
- Down a [[group]] -> Atomic radius **INCREASES**, going **TOP TO BOTTOM**, because [[shell]]s block [[proton pull]]
	- Reason:: [[shielding effect]]
