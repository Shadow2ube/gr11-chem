# Covalent [[compound]]
- [[Compound]] is a chemical bond between two non-metals when they share [[electron]] pairs
- Diatomic molecules are non-metal [[element]]s that exist naturally bonded with itself
	- HOBrFINCl
		- Hydrogen
		- Oxygen
		- Bromine
		- Fluorine
		- Iodine
		- Nitrogen
		- Chlorine

## [[nomenclature]]
- First element listed as is
- Second element added with suffix "ide"
- Prefixed added to denote teh number of each element
- mono is not added to the first element

## [[chemical formula]]
- use prefixes in the name to write the [[compound]]
- Eg: Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$)
