# Percent Yield
## Theoretical yield
- Compare the [[reactant]] that is the [[limiting reagent]] to the product
	- Determine how much product can be made
- Convert [[mole]]s to [[mass]] using [[molar mass]]

## Actual yield
- Found through experiment
- Tends to be lower than the [[#Theoretical yield]], due to lab [[errors]]

## Percent yield
- [[#Actual yield]] / [[#Theoretical yield]] * 100%
- Similar to [[percent composition]] calculations
