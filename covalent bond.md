# Covalent Bond
see [[Molecular compound]]

bonds formed between non-metals and metalloids

## Properties
- Low melting and boiling points
	- Low energy is required to overcome weak attractions between covalent molecules
- Soft or brittle solid forms
	- The weak [[intermolecular forces]] make the solid form of covalent molecules compounds easy to distort or break
- Poor electrical and thermal conductivity
- Flammable
- Generally less soluble in [[water]] than [[ionic compound]]s
- Can be a [[polar covalent bond]], a [[non-polar covalent bond]], or a [[pure covalent bond]]
