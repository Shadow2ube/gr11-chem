# Excess reagent
- Reactants that are not fully used up when the [[reaction]] is completed
	- Leftovers, since there is more than required

## To obtain
- Compare the [[limiting reagent]] mole number to the other reactant
	- Determine how much of the other reactant will be used (use [[stoichiometry ratio]])
- $Excess=Given-Required$
- Convert [[mole]]s to [[mass]]
	- $n=\frac{m}{M}$ -> $m=M*n$
