# Polarity
## Polar bonds -> see [[polar covalent bond]]
## Polar Molecules
- Contains a [[polar covalent bond]]
- Molecule must not be symmetrical
	- All vectors do not cancel eachother out
		- [[molecule shapes#linear]], [[molecule shapes#trigonal planer]], [[molecule shapes#tetrahedral]]
- Molecule can have polar bonds but be a [[non-polar covalent bond]]
- If all the atoms are not the same, the one with a higher electronegativity will pull the vector closer
