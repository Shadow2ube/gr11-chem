# Intermolecular forces
forces between molecules

## [[Non-polar covalent bond]]s
Experiences [[london disperson force]]s (LDFs)
- gases
- insoluble in [[water]]([[non-polar covalent bond]]s)

## [[Polar covalent bond]]s
Attraction is called dipole
- Attract opposite dipoles
	- Positive attracts negative ends of atoms
- Higher boiling point
	- More energy required to break the bonds
- The higher difference in [[electronegativity]], the stronger the dipole

## Hydrogen bond
Strongest intermolecular force
- One atom is hydrogen
- The other is part of FON (H -> FON)
	- Fluorine
	- Oxygen
	- Nitrogen
- Very strong dipole
	- Highest form of electronegativity
- Highest boiling points
	- more energy required to break the closer bond
