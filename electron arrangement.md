# [[Electron]] arrangement
Electrons have a big role in determining the physical and chemical properties of an element

## Arangements are related to position
- Elements in the same [[group]] (column) have the same outer orbital configuration in consecutivly higher energy levels
	- tldr: same amount of [[valence electron]]s
- Elements in the same [[period]] have outer electrons in the same energy level
	- tldr: same number of energy levels
