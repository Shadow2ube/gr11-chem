# [[Electron]] Affinity
Energy change that comes with the addition of an [[electron]] to a gaseous [[atom]]
- Most [[electron]] affinities are negative because most elements release energy when they become negative ions

## [[periodic trends]]
- Moving from across a period -> see [[ionization trends]]
	- TLDR: increases left to right
	- Reason: lower [[proton pull]] 
- Moving down a group -> see [[ionization trends]]
	- TLDR: decreases top to bottom
	- Reason: [[shielding effect]]
