# Electronegativity
- The tendency of an [[atom]] of a given element to attract electrons to the [[nucleus]]
- The ability of an atom to attract shared electrons in a covalent bond

## Trends
- Moving across a period -> **INCREASES**, going **LEFT TO RIGHT**
	- Reasons:
		- [[nuclear charge]] increases
		- [[radius of atom]] increases
		- More electrons, occupying the same energy levels, making them strongly attracted to the nucleus
- Moving down a group -> **DECREASES**, going **TOP TO BOTTOM**
	- Reasons:
		- [[radius of atom]] increases
		- [[shielding effect]]
		- electrons are. less strongly attracted

## TLDR
- Smaller atom, valence electrons are closer to the nucleus -> meaning positive nucleus can attract other electrons more strongly
