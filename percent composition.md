# Percentage composition
## Law of definite Proportions
- Chemical compounds always contain the exzct same proportion of elements by [[mass]]

## Percent Composition
- All compounds have a certain percent composition
- Percent composition is the percent of the total [[mass]] that each [[element]] has in the [[compound]]
- The percent of each element can be found by:
	- $\%\ by\ mass=\frac{mass\ of\ element}{total\ mass\ of\ substance}*100$

*NOTE: when calculating from a [[chemical formula]], assume you have 1 [[mole]]*
