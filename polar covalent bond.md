# Polar covalent bond
Covalent bonds in which the two atoms have a different [[electronegativity]], causing a separation of charges
- Difference in [[electronegativity]] of 0.4 or higher
	- Electrons are attracted to the atom with the higher [[electronegativity]]
- Creates a partial negativity in that atom and a partial positivity around the other
	- The separation of charges is called **dipole or [[polarity]] change**
	- Represented by $\delta+$  and $\delta-$ (delta + or -)
