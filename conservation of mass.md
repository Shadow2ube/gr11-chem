# Conservation of [[mass]]
- In a chemical [[reaction]], atoms cannot be created or destroyed
- The [[mass]] of reactants is equal to the [[mass]] of the products

*Note: When balancing, we work with the number of atoms of each element*

## Balanced [[chemical formula]]e
- Balanced equations are when the number of atoms of each element are the same on each side of an equation
	- The [[mass]] of one atom is alwas the same ([[proton]]s + [[neutron]]s)

### How to balance
*The goal of balancing is to get the same amount of each atom on both sides of the equation*
- You cannot change the chemical formula
- The coefficient in front of the molecules can change
- Consider Polyatomic ions as a unit
	- ex: $4 NO_3$ **NOT** $4 N$ & $12 O$

*Note: If an element appears in 2 separate compounds on the same side of the equation, and that [[compound]] is making the total of that side odd, place a 2 in front of it. The rest should balance*
