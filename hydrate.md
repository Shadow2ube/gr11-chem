# Hydrate
*Includes $H_2O$ in the [[chemical formula]] and name*

## [[nomenclature]]
- first name the [[ionic compound]] and then hydrate with the number [[#prefix]]

## [[Chemical formula]]
- name the [[ionic compound]], then add a dot connecting it to the hydrate ($H_2O$) with the coefficient with the number of hydrates
	- $CoF_2*7H_2O$
		- Cobalt fluoride heptahydrate

### prefix
1. mono
2. di
3. tri
4. tetra
5. penta
6. hexa
7. hepta
8. nona
9. deca

## Determine coefficients
1. Requires [[mass]] of [[terms#Anhydrous]] and the [[mass]] of [[water]]
2. Change both values to [[mole]]s
3. Find the ratio by dividing both by the smaller of the two
	- Similar to [[empirical formula]] calculations
